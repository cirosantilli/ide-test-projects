Further comments:

* you have to setup a bunch of JSON files manually, can't find templates on C/C++ plugin (1.38.1)
* the documentation documents WSL, MacOS and MinGW, and MSVC, but not Linux distros. As a result you follow WSL and skip a bunch of WSL specific crap that is not needed on Linux (1.38.1)
