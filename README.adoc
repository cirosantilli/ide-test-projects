== vscodium

* Call hierarchy: no https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/16 (1.38.1)
* Distribution packages:
** Ubuntu: no (19.04)
* Extension system
** Install extensions from command line: yes, e.g.: `codium --install-extension ms-python.python` https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34286515/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-extensions-from-command-line (1.38.1)
* Find references to possible virtual method calls: no, marked at `[Not a reference]` (1.38.1)
* Languages
** C++: yes, official extension: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools
** Python: yes, official extension: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python
*** Eliminates impossible method references by class: no (1.38.1)
* GDB step debug: yes, but setup is annoying on Linux (1.38.1)
* Git trackable project configuration: yes, JSON (1.38.1)
* Jump to file: Ctrl + P (1.38.1)
* Method overview of current file: Ctrl + Shift + O https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36154283/method-list-in-visual-studio-code (1.38.1)
* Type hierarchy: no https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/3799 (1.38.1)

Further comments:

* you have to setup a bunch of JSON files manually, can't find templates on C/C++ plugin (1.38.1)
* the documentation documents WSL, MacOS and MinGW, and MSVC, but not Linux distros. As a result you follow WSL and skip a bunch of WSL specific crap that is not needed on Linux (1.38.1)
