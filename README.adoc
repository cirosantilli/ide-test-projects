== vscodium

* Call hierarchy: no https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/16 (1.38.1)
* Distribution packages:
** Ubuntu: no (19.04)
* Extension system
** Install extensions from command line: yes, e.g.: `codium --install-extension ms-python.python` https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34286515/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-extensions-from-command-line (1.38.1)
* Languages
** C++: yes, official extension: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools
*** custom include paths: finds in-project paths automatically, must be fragile
*** find references to possible polymorphic virtual method calls: no, marked at `[Not a reference]` (1.38.1)
** Python: yes, official extension: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python
*** Eliminates impossible method references by class: no (1.38.1)
* GDB step debug: yes, but setup is annoying on Linux (1.38.1)
* Git trackable project configuration: yes, JSON (1.38.1)
* Jump to file: Ctrl + P (1.38.1)
* Method overview of current file: Ctrl + Shift + O https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36154283/method-list-in-visual-studio-code (1.38.1)
* Type hierarchy: no https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/3799 (1.38.1)

Further comments:

* you have to setup a bunch of JSON files manually, can't find templates on C/C++ plugin (1.38.1)
* the documentation documents WSL, MacOS and MinGW, and MSVC, but not Linux distros. As a result you follow WSL and skip a bunch of WSL specific crap that is not needed on Linux (1.38.1)

== pycharm

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19912452/pycharm-getting-the-project-dir-in-the-run-debug-configuration-window

* Distribution packages:
** Snap: yes, `sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic` (2019.2.3)
* Languages:
** Python: yes? :-)
*** Eliminates impossible method references by class: yes (2019.2.3)
* Git trackable project configuration: somewhat, a bunch of large-ish XML (2019.2.3)
* Jump to file: Ctrl + Shift + N (2019.2.3)
* Meta variables for run (e.g. `${PROJECT_ROOT}`): no??? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19912452/pycharm-getting-the-project-dir-in-the-run-debug-configuration-window
* Type hierarchy: yes, Ctrl + H

== Eclipse

* Call hierarchy: Ctrl + Alt + H (2019-09 R (4.13.0))
* Git trackable project configuration: likely not, horrendous XML, does not track basic project properties such as custom C++ include paths, horrendously generic names like `.project` and `.cproject`
* Jump to file: Ctrl + Shift + R (2019-09 R (4.13.0))
* Sees standard library: yes, but you have to spend half an hour to find out how!!! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10373788/how-to-solve-unresolved-inclusion-iostream-in-a-c-file-in-eclipse-cdt/51099533#51099533
** C++: yes, official extension: CDT
*** custom include paths: yes, Project Properties, Preprocessor Include Paths, GNU C++, CDT User Setting Entries
*** find references to possible polymorphic virtual method calls: yes
*** UML: no https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3155448/eclipse-plugin-for-generating-uml-diagram-from-c-code
*** view method override tree: Ctrl + T (Type hierarchy)

* Type hierarchy: yes, F4 (2019-09 R (4.13.0))
** Method in type hierarchy: yes, Ctrl + T for quick, F4 for docked with the method highlighted: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17078749/eclipse-shortcut-to-find-all-children-class-that-override-a-method (2019-09 R (4.13.0))
